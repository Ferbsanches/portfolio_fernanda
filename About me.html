            <h1>Some more <span> About me: </span></h1>
            <p> I am from Brazil, and I am now a <strong> Junior Mechanical Engineering student</strong> at the University of South Florida (USF) in Tampa. </p> 
            <p> My greatest passion is turning ideas into reality, which fuels my love for <strong> manufacturing, 3D printing, designing, and prototyping.</strong> Recently, I have developed a keen interest in project management and am eager to explore this field further. </p>
            <p> Throughout my college years, I have remained actively engaged, seeking meaningful and practical experiences.
            <p>I currently serve as the <strong>Technical Development Director</strong> for the American Society of Mechanical Engineers (ASME) and am a proud member of the <strong>Judy Genshaft Honors College at USF</strong>. My professional journey includes an <strong>internship </strong>at a pharmaceutical company, as well as extensive involvement in various <strong>projects</strong> where I’ve honed my skills in leading multicultural teams.</p>

             I started my journey as a Biomedical Engineering student, as I had the wish to join my passion for engineering and my desire to help people. I loved everything I learned, but I realized I loved machines, manufacturing, and mechanical engineering even more, so I decided to take the risk and switch majors.

             As a Mechanical Engineering Student, I have been loving to explore the machines, study mechanisms, and understand how things work.
