            <p> Main activities:  </p>
            <p>-  Led designing and integrating a 3D-printed servo-controlled pick-up mechanism into the drone frame, developing creative 
                solutions employed through team-based brainstorming and iterative prototype testing.  </p>
            <p>-  Conducted material testing to identify the optimal combination for drone components, selecting carbon fiber for the frame and 
                TPU for other to maximize durability and functionality.  </p>
                <p> -  Secured 2nd place in the ASME Drone Race Challenge, showcasing the teamâ€™s innovative design and technical execution.</p>
